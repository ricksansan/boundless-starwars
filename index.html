                    <p>A long time ago, in a blockchain far, far away…</p>
                    <p>Across the galaxy, mighty chains had risen. The ancient citadels of Ethereum, the lightning lanes of Solana, the polygonal legions of Polygon… All were competing to become the ultimate center of power.</p>
                    <p>But behind this dazzling brilliance of chains lurked a deep darkness. Every transaction was visible to all; secrets lay naked for the world to see. Who did what, which wallet held which fortune, which contract authorized what — all of it etched onto the chain.</p>
                    <p>And the chain was crawling under the claws of greedy miners and validator barons. Gas fees were sky-high. Privacy was extinct. On-chain computations shackled the chain with massive transaction blocks, turning it into a lumbering beast.</p>
